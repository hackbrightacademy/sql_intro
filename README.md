SQL Introduction
================

Run the file `quiz.py`. Read the directions carefully for your first task. Try typing a solution into the prompt.

When you input the correct SQL statement for the task described, your solution will be __automagically__ saved in the file `answers.sql`. (You don't need to copy/paste from the prompt to save your solution.)
When the output of the `quiz.py` script tells you that you're finished, please have your `answers.sql` file code-reviewed by an instructor.  
You can also check in the `answers.sql` file to github to save your work.

HINT: In order to better understand the schema of the table that is mentioned in each task, use:
```
.schema TABLE_NAME
```
